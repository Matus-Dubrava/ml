```{r}
head(Smarket)
```
```{r}
train = Smarket$Year != 2005
Smarket.2005 = Smarket[!train,]
Direction.2005 = Smarket$Direction[!train]
```

```{r}
lda.fit = lda(Direction~Lag1+Lag2, data=Smarket, subset=train)
lda.fit
```

```{r}
lda.pred = predict(lda.fit, Smarket.2005)
names(lda.pred)
```
```{r}
lda.class = lda.pred$class
table(lda.class, Direction.2005)
```
```{r}
print(sum(lda.pred$posterior[,1] >= 0.5))
print(sum(lda.pred$posterior[,1] < 0.5))
```

Let's increase the threshold to see how many days there are when the model predicts the market to go up with the probability of at least 90%.
```{r}
sum(lda.pred$posterior[,1] >= 0.9)
```
Apparently, our model was never cetrain with the 90% probability or more that the marker will go up at any given day.
